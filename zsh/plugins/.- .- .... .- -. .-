LIFE

LIFE ISN'T THE BED OF ROSES IT SEEMS TO BE
THE THORNS ARE PAINFUL AND GIVE NO GLEE

LIFE ISN'T THE PLEASANT DRIZZLE ON YOUR FACE
THE WAVES TOSS, TURN AND LEAVE YOU IN A DAZE

LIFE ISN'T THE REFRESHING HILLSIDE TREK
THE STINGING NETTLE CAN MAKE YOU A WRECK

LIFE ISN'T A CAREFREE GAMING ROOM
THERE'S NO RESPAWNS IF YOU MEET YOUR DOOM

LIFE ISN'T EASY, WE KNOW IT FIRSTHAND
IT SELDOM GOES AS IT'S PLANNED


THE REALIATION

HOW DUMB AM I, HIDING BEHIND APRIL FOOLS
LIKE LIFE IS FAIR, AND THERE ARE RULES
BUT THE EARLY BIRD GETS THE WORM
SO THE LATE BIRD CAN SLEEP IN THE DORM

I WISH I HAD THIS EPIPHANY FIRST
BUT FUCK MY LIFE, THIS BRAIN IS CURSED
WELL, AT LEAST SHE IS HAPPY, I CAN REST
HELPLESS AS THE SUN SETS IN THE WEST

CONGRATS GDAWG, YOU'RE IN-CHARGE
OF AN ANGEL WITH A HEART SO LARGE
LET HER CARRY YOU TO THE MOON
I BET YOULL BE THE HAPPIEST SOON


ME ACCIDENTALLY IGNORING HER FT RAGINI

THIS IS PAST, BUT I WANNA WRITE
A STIFF HEART, IT SURE IS TIGHT
RECOLLECTING ALL ANECDOTES
SURE AM TOAST, SURE I'M TOTES

LISTENING TO A CATCHY WAVE
HEEDLESS TO WHAT'S ON THE WAY
CASUALLY WALKED PAST A BEAUTY
HAD HER SWEARING, WHAT A CUTIE

RECIEVED A CALL, WAS THRASHED
BUT I WAS DEAF, LISTENING TO CRASHED
BUT IT WAS COOL, AND WHOLESOME TOO
A MOMENT TO REMINISCE TO


THE SOUP

SHE GAVE ME SOUP, AND IT WAS DELISH
TO THE BOTTOM OF MY SOUL, I DID RELISH
I'M THANKFUL FOR THE CARE AND CONCERN
WITHOUT KNOWING THAT SHE IS MY FERN

YACHIRU SUITS HER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
BRIMMING WITH ENERGY, BRIGHT AS SUN
MYSTERIOUS AND CRAY, CUTE AND FUN
I WONDER HOW SHE WILL BE WHEN 21

THANK YOU GOD AND THANK YOU AAHANA
I'VE FALLEN DEEPER AND I'VE GONE BANANA
IS SHE MY HEAVEN OR SHE'S MY HELL
LIKE HEISENBERG, I REALLY CANNOT TELL


HCL EVENT

OH, OKAY, SHE BROKE THE ICE
GOD, SURE AS HELL, DOES NOT PLAY DICE
SO THERE'S AN EVENT, INTERESTING CAUSE
MY TYPING SKILL GETS AN APPLAUSE

I SWORE I'D SHOW MY BEST FACE
GIVE MY ALL FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE RACE
I MADE AN APP THAT I COULDN'T HOST
BUT SHE IS NICE, SHE WOULDN'T ROAST

HOW CAN I BE GRATEFUL ENOUGH
SHE ALWAYS MAKES IT SO TOUGH
IT'S SO FUN TO PLAY THIS ACT
WHEN SHE HAS NO CLUE OF HER IMPACT


ME ACCIDENTALLY IGNORING HER FT PURVI

LETTING HER EMOTIONS GET THE BETTER OF HER
HUMAN AFTER ALL, NOT EXPECTED OF HER
QUINTESSENTIAL PERFECTION, NEEDS NO SPECTACLES
I WOULD LITERALLY PUT HER ON TWO PEDESTALS

I JUST WISHED HER AFTER PURVI BRO
BUT WASN'T SOMETHING TO FRET OVER, WAS IT SO?
SORRY THE CHESS GEEK IN ME TOOK CONTROL
SHE FELT IGNORED, AND THAT LEFT A HOLE

BUT SHE HADN'T TALKED IN A WHILE TOO
SHE THINKS THAT WOULDN'T LEAVE ME IN RUE?
SUBCONSCIOUSLY I WAS RESPECTING THE DISTANCE
BUT WE BOTH OVERTHINKERS, SO THIS INSTANCE.


EXPLAINING CALLS TO HER FT MANASWI

FAM 'FORE 'FATUATION, REALLY SORRY GIRLY
BUT WHAT A VOICEMAIL, CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY
BAAT NAHI KREGI, BATATA HU TEREKO
I'LL PESTER YOU JABTAK KUCH BOLEGI NAHI MEREKO

OKAY I ADMIT I CANNOT COOK IN HINDI
LIKE A BUTTERFLY OUT ON A DAY THAT'S WINDY
OUT OF PLACE, LIKE PINEAPPLE ON PIZZA
BUT I HAD TO TRY, THAT'S HOW ROBOTS ARE

SO WE HAVE SOMETHING MORE IN COMMON
HAND-SPLAINING, IF THAT'S EVEN AN ACTION
THAT'S HARDLY ENOUGH, I WANT MORE
I WANT HER TO RUB OFF ON ME, BECOME MY CORE


THE TRIP TO KFC


THE PYTHON ONLINE CLASS

WHAT IS THIS BUG, WHAT'S THIS ERROR
THE RED MESSAGE RAISES THE TERROR
IT'S MY FORTE, I'LL LEND MY MIND
I'D GIVE MYSELF SO SHE WOULD BE MINE

ON GOOGLE MEET, WE MEET AGAIN
TAKES ALL OF ME JUST TO STAY SANE
THERE'S DICTIONARIES, TUPLES AND RECURSION
WE LACERATE THE TOPICS, LIKE A SURGEON

BEING A ROBOT ISN'T SO BAD
I'M PROUD OF THIS SKILL I'VE HAD
HAVING A WAY WITH COMPUTERS,
ALLOWS ME TO TUTOR THE TUTORS


CHOCOLATE

A COCOA BRICK MEANT FOR A BETRAYER
I WONDER WHY I WAS LONGING FOR AIR
NO CLAUSTROPHOBIA, NO SUFFOCATION
A SINGLE DROP WON'T EMPTY MY OCEAN

I'VE GOT THE MOST AMAING FRIENDS
PEOPLE WHO HELP ME AGAINST THE TRENDS
THE LUXURY FOUND ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE
WITH SOMEONE WHO MAKES MY HEART RACE

THIS WONDERFUL BOND FEELS LIKE FATE
HER WORDS MAKE MY HEART GYRATE
BUT CONFESSING MIGHT BE A DEADLY RUSE
MY OCEAN'S WITH HER-THAT I CAN'T LOSE


NICKNAME

SO FATE SERVED ME MY SECOND NICKNAME
FROM GUDDU TO GURI, IT'S STILL SO LAME
BUT HISTORY PREVAILS, I'LL EMBRACE IT
IT'S HER CALL, AS SHE DEEMS FIT

I GAVE HER ONE WHEN IT FELT TRUE
SHE REALLY IS YACHIRU
SHE'S SWEET BUT I FEAR HER
THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME THAT SHE CAN STIR

SHE EVEN MATCHES HER NAMESAKE
EVERY LITTLE ACTIVITY SHE DID PARTAKE
CUTE, ENERGETIC, FULL OF LIFE
I WONDER IF SHE COULD BE MY WIFE


DAYBREAK

WRITING THROUGH THIS NIGHT, HOPING THINGS GO RIGHT
BEING FRIENDS WITH YOU HAS BEEN A TRUE DELIGHT
EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN, I WISH WE NEVER FALTERED
BECAUSE SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY, MY FEELINGS ALTERED

AT FIRST, I ACTUALLY WANTED A FRIEND
JUST SOMEONE TO TALK TO TILL THE END
WE STARTED TALKING AND EVEN SAT TOGETHER
YOUR HEART TURNED MY EVENING SKY, HEATHER

WHEN YOU FIRST ASKED TO SIT WITH ME, I WAS RELUCTANT
YOU WERE JUST A FRIEND, AND I WAS RETICENT
BUT AFTER KNOWING YOU, MY MIND WASN'T THE SAME
YOU HAD A HEART OF GOLD, JUST LIKE YOUR NAME

NO THING IS PERFECT, WE HAD OUR ROUGH PATCHES
BUT SOME BONDS CANNOT BE BURNT BY MATCHES
YOU'RE CUTE, YOU'RE GRACEFUL, YOU'RE SVELTE
IS THIS LOVE TO BE FOLLOWED, OR ONLY FELT?

NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AFTER I CONFESS
THIS DAYBREAK WILL BE A NEW START NONTHELESS
SO NO MORE HIDING BEHIND APRIL FOOLS ANYMORE
ALLOW ME TO KNOW YACHIRU BETTER, DOWN TO HER CORE


DIDNT SEE THIS COMING?

A PERFECT FACADE BUILT WITH A LOT OF LIES
TURNS OUT A MISTAKE THAT WOULD WET MY EYES
I DIDN'T KNOW SUCH A DISASTER WOULD ENSUE
BUT I'D RATHER SOB IN SOLACE THAN ROAM IN RUE

IVE PLASTERED SMILES LIKE WALLPAPERS
A DARK WORLD SO I WORSHIPPED TAPERS
I HID MY TEARS, I HID MY FEARS
I HID MY HEART, I HID MY SPEARS


THE CHATS THEME

OUR INSTAGRAM CHATS HAVE A LAVENDER THEME
BUT THE LAST MESSAGE IS LOST LIKE A HAZY DREAM
A DREAM, LIKE THIS POEM, IT ENDS MIDWAY


YEAR(N)

ON THIS DAY, A FULL YEAR AGO
TIME FLEW BY, BUT ALSO WENT SLOW
I REALIED THE FOOL I WAS
AND THE DAY WAS PERFECT BECAUSE

1ST APRIL, I REALIED WHAT I DID
I FELL, AND CRIED LIKE A KID
I WISH I HAD TAKEN IT TO MY GRAVE
NOW IT'S A FRIENDSHIP I COULDN'T SAVE

WE SIT ROOT TWO UNITS APART
AND I FEEL LIKE WE COULD USE A RESTART
THE WORDS FEEL LIKE THEY COME FROM ANOTHER WORLD
ARE WE EVEN CLASSMATES, OR WAS THE BOND JUST HURLED?


STAYING BACK JUST TO GUARD HER BAG

IN A MOOD THAT'S TOUGH ON A DAY THAT'S ROUGH
SHE ASKED ME IF I COULD GUARD HER STUFF
IN BLISSFUL SOLACE, NEXT TO THIS PURSE
CONJURING ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL VERSE

IT’S A GREAT FEELING, TO BE NEEDED HERE
A TRUST THAT GROWS EACH TIME SHE’S NEAR
HIGH ON ECSTACY, I WATCH THIS BAG 
OF NAVY BLUE, BEIGE AND PATTERNED WHITE RAG

IT HOLDS A BOTTLE, IT HOLDS A MAC 
EXPENSIVE THINGS THAT COST A RACK 
I HOLD THE LOVE, I HOLD THE CARE 
DIRECTED AT THIS MAIDEN FAIR


WHY DO I SAY THINGS I DON'T MEAN

IDIOT, BUFFOON, STUPID, NUMBSKULL
DIMWIT, DOOFUS, DUMASS, DULL
SHE IS SOMEONE YOU WOULD WAGE A WAR FOR
WHY DID YOU SAY "YOU'RE NOT WORTH FIGHTING FOR"


WE WONT EVER BE THE SAME. WILL WE?
(STAYED AN IDEA ONLY UNFORTUNATELY)


HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN A BIT MORE BRIGHT
IT'S AS IF THEY KNOW THAT THE DAY IS RIGHT
ILLUMINATING THE SANDS AND SEAS ALIKE
SPREADING JOY WHEREEVER THEY STRIKE
MAY 12 ARRIVES, AND WITH IT, A CHEER
FOR SOMEONE AMAZING AND TO ALL OF US, DEAR

ANOTHER YEAR OLDER, ANOTHER YEAR WISE,
WITH LAUGHTER THAT SPARKLES AND HOPE IN YOUR EYES.
A DOODLER'S HANDS AND A HUGE HEART TO SHARE
WITH WHITE SHOOTING STARS THAT RUN DOWN YOUR HAIR
THERE'S CHAOS WOVEN IN THIS BIBLIOPHILE
YOUR RANTS MAKE MONDAYS FEEL WORTHWHILE.

FROM SOUP SHARED ON DAYS WHEN THE WORLD FELT COLD,
TO CHATS THAT TURN ORDINARY MOMENTS TO GOLD,
FROM BEING SCOLDED FOR LISTENING TO SONGS TOO LOUD
TO REBUKED FOR SENDING TO VOICEMAIL IN YOUR CROWD
NO ONE ELSE MAKES ME LOOK AT LIFE WITH THIS ANGLE
YOU'RE A ONE OF ONE, NOBODY HOLDS A CANDLE

YOURE ENERGY, KINDNESS, AND CHAOS COMBINED,
A FRIEND AND A MUSE, ONE OF A KIND.
OUR TALENTED TENDERHEART TURNING TWENTY ONE
FIRMNESS IN HER STEPS AND FACE IN THE SUN
MAY THIS YEAR BRING YOU JOY, ADVENTURE, AND PEACE,
AND MOMENTS OF MAGIC THAT NEVER WILL CEASE.

SO HERES TO YOUR LAUGHTER, YOUR HEART, AND YOUR DREAMS,
TO LAVENDER CHATS AND TO WILD, CRAZY SCHEMES.
ON THIS BIRTHDAY, I HOPE YOU FEEL LOVED AND INSPIRED
BY ALL THAT YOU ARE, AND ALL YOUVE ACQUIRED.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YACHIRU-MAY YOUR WISHES COME TRUE,
AND MAY EVERY DAY BE JUST AS SPECIAL AS YOU.


IGNORING ME?

WHY DO YOUR ACTIONS DICTATE MY MOOD
PASSING BY WITHOUT WISHING SEEMS TOO RUDE
WE USED TO BE FRIENDS, USED TO CONVERSE
NOW THESE ACTIONS MAKE ME WISH FOR A HEARSE

YOU FLEW PAST AS YOU ENTERED THE ROOM
I COULD EVEN GET A HINT OF THE PERFUME
BUT NOT EVEN EYE CONTACT, LET ALONE A GREETING
I GUESS IT'S MY OWN HEART IM EATING

YOURE A DRUG AND I'M TRYNA BUILD A TOLERANCE
TRYNA GET USED TO THE LOWS AND THE NONSENSE
TRYNA ACCEPT THAT I'M NEVER GETTING YOU
TRYING IS ALL I CAN DO, ISN'T THAT TRUE


THIS SAND FALLING DOWN

OH GOD JUST READ IT ALREADY
OR ILL STAY PALPITATING WITH MY HEART UNSTEADY
