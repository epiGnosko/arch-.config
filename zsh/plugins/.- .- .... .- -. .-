the realization

how dumb am I, hiding behind april fools
like life is fair, and there are rules 
but the early bird gets the worm 
so the late bird can sleep in the dorm 

I wish I had this epiphany first 
but fuck my life, this brain is cursed 
well atleast she is happy, I can rest 
helpless as the sun goes from east to west

congrats GDawg, you're in-charge
of an angel with a heart so large 
let her carry you to the moon
I bet youll be the happiest soon


me accidentally ignoring her ft ragini

This is past, but I wanna write 
a stiff heart, it sure is tight
recollecting all anecdotes 
Sure am toast, sure am totes

Listening to a catchy wave
heedless to what's on the way
casually walked past a beauty 
had her swearing, what a cutie

recieved a call, was thrashed 
but I was deaf, listening to Crashed
but it was cool, and wholesome too
A moment to reminisce to


the soup

she gave me soup, and it was delish 
to the bottom of my soul, I did relish
I'm thankful for the care and concern 
without knowing that she is my fern

Yachiru suits her in more ways than one 
brimming with energy, bright as sun 
mysterious and crazy, cute and fun 
I wonder how she will be when 21

Thank you god and thank you aahana 
I've fallen deeper and I've gone banana
is she my heaven or she's my hell 
like heisenberg, I really cannot tell


HCL event

OH, OKAY, SHE BROKE THE ICE
god, sure as hell, does not play dice
So there's an event, interesting cause 
my typing skill gets an applause
